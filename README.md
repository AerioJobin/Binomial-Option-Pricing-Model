Binomial Option Pricing Model
The Binomial Option Pricing Model is used to estimate the price of options by simulating possible price movements of the underlying asset. It is particularly useful for pricing American options, which can be exercised at any time before expiration.

Model Inputs
Underlying Price (S): The current price of the underlying asset.
Strike Price (K): The price at which the option can be exercised.
Time to Expiration (T): The time remaining until the option expires (in years).
Risk-Free Rate (r): The annualized risk-free interest rate.
Volatility (Ïƒ): The annualized volatility of the underlying asset's returns.
Number of Steps (n): The number of time steps in the binomial tree.
Functionality
The model calculates the theoretical price of both call and put options for European and American exercise types.
